<p>We went up so many <strong>towers</strong> and cupolas this summer in Tuscany! They are all amazing in their own way and the view over <strong>the red-tiled roofs</strong> at the end of the climb is definitely a <em>big</em> reward. But certainly not the <em>only</em> one.&nbsp;The (sometimes wonky)&nbsp;internal structures, the patina covering the bricks and stones, the fleeting glimpses of the outside through the slits in the thick walls, the surfaces made silk-smooth by the touch of a multitude of climbers over the centuries, they are all very remarkable too. I shot this picture on the way down the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_del_Mangia">Torre del Mangia</a>, in Siena. The sense of vertigo is only partially rendered by the HDR effect. However, the presence of my beautiful wife in the frame gives a proper sense of scale to the whole place.</p>
