<p>I don't like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_dei_Miracoli">Piazza dei Miracoli</a> in <strong>Pisa</strong>. I never did. It's overcrowded and silly. So, when my wife asked me to pass by Pisa to see the leaning tower, I was admittedly less than excited. However, we were smart enough to book the climbing of the tower ar <strong>sunset</strong>. Not only the light was perfect, but a <strong>large storm</strong> with dark, low clouds was gathering opposite of the sunset direction, which made the horizon even more dramatic. <strong>Regretfully</strong>, I have to admit it was really fun...</p>
