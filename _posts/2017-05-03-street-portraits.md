<p>This weekend, the students of the Chalmers university organized the traditional Cortege procession. To get an idea, imagine a carnival parade with plenty of humour and fun. Quite remarkably, it has been <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cort%C3%A8ge">organized every year since 1909</a>. The students and alumni get together to celebrate their 'alma mater' and all wear the typical student hat (il looks a bit like the cap of a sea captain).</p>
<p>I took advantage of the relaxed and fun atmosphere to ask many participants to pose for my camera and they have been great sports.</p>

<p>But in the happy chaos all around, it was also easy to snap candid pictures.</p>

<p>That's it for now. It's "game over" until I'll find some more time to go shooting again (lately it's been more and more challenging).Â </p>
