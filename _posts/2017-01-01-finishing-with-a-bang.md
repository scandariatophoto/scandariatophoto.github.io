<p>We flew to Italy for Christmas, to join the family in Torino. It was a great time with lots of good food and heart-warming moments. Like, for instance, the small concert organized by my brother and his family.</p>

<p>They even sang in German for my wife. Pure cuteness! Of course, when I say "family" I mean the <em>extended</em> family, which also includes this adorable Boston-terrier-come-Tasmanian-devil, named <strong>Astrid</strong> ;)</p>

<p>Torino is beautiful as usual. Piazza San Carlo is always impressive in its vastness and geometrical perfection.</p>

<p>But there are other gems, outside of the city center. For instance, meet the <a target="_blank" href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_La_Tesoriera">Villa La Tesoriera</a>, a place near the neighbourhood I grew up in. It was built in the 18th century and it is surrounded by a large parc. It's a good place for a Sunday stroll in springtime.</p>

<p>We had the time to visit the newly renovated <a target="_blank" href="http://www.museoegizio.it/en/">Egyptian museum</a>. After the museum in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Museum">Cairo</a>, this is <strong>the</strong> Egyptian archeological collection to see. The new structure is sleek, spacious, functional and very modern. However, the coziness of the old museum is gone. For instance, I miss the signature room with mummies and sarcofagi crammed all over the place they had in the old times.</p>

<p>On our last day, we went to <a target="_blank" href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parco_Europa">Parco Europa</a>, a parc on top of a hill with a spectacular lookout over the industrial part of the city. From there, on a clear day, you can almost touch the Alps surrounding Torino and you can spot some landmarks like the FIAT head quarters (Mirafiori) with its chimneys, the historical automobile factory of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingotto">Lingotto</a> (with the parabolic test track on the roof) and the red Olympic Arch connecting Lingotto to the colourful olympic village (legacy of the 2016 Winter Olympic Games).</p>
