<p>Hello ! </p>
<p>I just lunched my photography site and I'm very excited about it. I started taking photography a bit more seriously in November 2014, when I bought a "real" camera for my birthday. I got immediately hooked and now it has become one of my biggest passions. From now on, I will post here the pictures I like the most and hope you will enjoy them. The goal is to post a new picture every week. We will see if I stick to the plan ;)</p>
<p>As this is my first post and there aren't many pictures on this page yet, you can head to my portfolio and the other two galleries. The first gallery is about the <strong>city of Gothenburg</strong> in Sweden, a <strong>fantastic place</strong> I've been living in for about 18 months now. The city is <strong>at the sea</strong> and has an impressive amount of <strong>islands just off the cost</strong>. They are magnificently beautiful in all seasons. This group of islands is called the Archipelago, and I have a gallery about it.</p>
<p>That's it for now... take care and come back soon.</p>
