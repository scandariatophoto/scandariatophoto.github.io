<p>Hello !</p><p>With only a few minutes left to comply with my Facebook challenge, here is my third picture showing the beauty of nature . This one was taken on a May afternoon, after a small picnic on the lake's shore in company of a couple of friends and a very cute toddler.&nbsp;</p><p>That's it for now... take care and enjoy the weekend.</p>
