<p>Last weekend we went exploring one of the many lakes near Gothenburg (Mj√∂rn). The country side around there was pretty. When we suddenly drove by a recently mown hay field, I couldn't resist. I hade to stop the car, grab the camera from the booth and take a picture (while my wife was waiting patiently in the car). I was drawn by the peaceful contrast between the yellow field and the faint blue cloudy sky. But then I moved a few meters to the side and I saw this RV, "parked" in the back yard of a farm. It added an extra layer to the scene and made the story.&nbsp;It looked like a cool, spooky place for kids to play. Or the the rustic hideout of a serial killer.&nbsp;I still can't decide :) The half-opend door was quite terryfing anyway...</p>
