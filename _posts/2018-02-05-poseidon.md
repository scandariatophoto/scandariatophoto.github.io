<p>The time for outdoor photography is becoming fewer and fewer (I wonder why!). But one late afternoon I had to go to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Götaplatsen">Götaplatsen</a> and decided to take my camera with me. I tried to find a novel composition for the famous statue of Poseidon, which is a well-photographed city landmark. In the distance, you can see the tower of <a target="_blank" href="http://liseberg.com/en/home">Liseberg</a></p>
