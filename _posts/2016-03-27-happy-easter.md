<p>Hello !</p>
<p>This Easter weekend we we took a ferry from Saltholmen (near Gothenburg) and reached the <strong>souther-most island</strong> of the Archipelago, Vrångö. The island offers several easy hiking trails and glorious sea views. I snapped this one without thinking too much. Although the light was quite harsh, the photo came out quite nice. And some tweaking of the colors also helped ;)</p>
<p>That''s it for now... eat more chocolate and come back soon.</p>
