<p>Hello !</p>
<p>Today, it feels silly to post pictures of nature in reaction to a Facebook challenge. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35869254">What happened this morning in Brussels</a>  makes me very sad. I lived in Belgium for <em><strong>9 years</strong></em> and I feel touched on a personal level by this all. As a response, I'm posting a picture taken during a happy day at the Belgian coast in company of some good friends.</p>
<p>That's it for now... </p>
