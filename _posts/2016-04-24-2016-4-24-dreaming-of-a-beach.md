<p>Hello !</p><p>It's 7 degrees in Sweden and I heard it was snowing in Belgium today. Crazy stuff.&nbsp;It seems like the spring season is never coming this year and the summer holiday is still far far away. And yet, I find myself dreaming of a beach vacation more and more often these days. As such, discovering this boat docked in Gothenburg felt like a sign*. I'll keep dreaming till the day will actually come :)</p><p>That's it for now... hold on till the weather turns for the better.</p><p>*Strand means beach in Swedish,&nbsp;German,&nbsp;Dutch and pretty much any other Germanic language.</p>
