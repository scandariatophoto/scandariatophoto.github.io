<p>Hello !</p>
<p>It's 7 degrees in Sweden and I heard it was snowing in Belgium today. Crazy stuff. It seems like the spring season is never coming this year and the summer holiday is still far far away. And yet, I find myself dreaming of a beach vacation more and more often these days. As such, discovering this boat docked in Gothenburg felt like a sign*. I'll keep dreaming till the day will actually come :)</p>
<p>That's it for now... hold on till the weather turns for the better.</p>
<p>*Strand means beach in Swedish, German, Dutch and pretty much any other Germanic language.</p>
