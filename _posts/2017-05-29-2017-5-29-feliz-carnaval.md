<p>Believe it or not, in Sweden they have a <strong>carnival parade</strong> in May. Probably because it's too cold to go around (often half naked) in February/March. It's in <strong>Hammarkulle</strong>, in the outskirts of Gothenburg. According to Wikipedia, the carnival started in 1974 and soon got "adopted" by the <strong>Latin-American community</strong>. Today, they say it's the biggest carnival of Sweden... but don't get too excited. Expressions like "largest of Scandinavia" or "biggest of Sweden" are slightly over-used in Gothenburg as, allegedly, we have the biggest amusement park, the largest botanic garden, the biggest exhibition centre, the largest wedding fair, the biggest horse fair... I discovered the carnival in Hammarkulle thanks to a good photo friend who took me there (thx Gunnar!).&nbsp;Most of the latino communities are well represented and put up a great show with music, dances and fantastic costumes (there are no carriages, just a few Cuba-style old-timer cars). And the local samba school shows up in forces. From a photo perspective, the funniest part has been the "getting ready". Everybody was very relaxed and more then willing to pose for the may photographers (professional and amateurs). Also the police were very relaxed and let me stay in front of the fences without much trouble.</p>
