<p>This weekend, my wife and I went to our favourite cafe in the Northern Archipelago of Gothenburg. After a delicious slice of raspberry pie, we went for a short walk on the rocky coast of Hälsö island. The conditions weren't ideal for a walk (cold and cloudy) but quite interesting for photography. I took my 24mm with me, plus the tripod and my variable 1-to-8 stops ND filter. </p>
