<p>Hello !</p><p>This is the end of my Facebook challenge, which involved posting 7 pictures about nature, once per day. As they say, let's hope we <em><strong>finish with a bang :) </strong></em></p><p>This picture has been taken during a glorious sunset in a location that is only a few meters away from my place. It's a popular swimming place in summer and I think that the coolest thing in the picture is the turtle-shaped rock on the left. I didn't notice the resemblance until I came back home and I looked at the picture on my laptop. As a photographer, I should really be more observant :P</p><p>All right, after a busy week of posts on the blog, I'll take a short break for Easter and I'll come back next week with more pictures (hopefully!)</p><p>That's it for now... take care and enjoy some Easter eggs.</p>
