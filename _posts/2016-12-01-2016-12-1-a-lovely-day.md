<p>To close the week-long celebrations for my birthday (yes, it <em>is</em> that important) my photo assistant (ehm... wife) took me to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universeum.se/en/">Universeum</a> in Gothenburg. It's a strange mix of tropical jungle, plus aquarium, plus science museum for kids (like me).</p><p>It's next to the Lieseberg amusement park and has a ginormous, two-story tall brontosaurus to mark the entrance.</p>

<p>The tropical jungle is, well, tropical (i.e., humid as hell). The main attraction is a family of scarlet ibis (ibises? whatever...). They are very colourful and spend most of their time perched on a large branch while cleaning their feathers. They look bored. But I imagine a gigantic glass box filled with humans is not the most entertaining and engaging environment when you are a bird.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part (by far!) were the large tanks with the sharks. Me and the other kids couldn't have enough of the <strong>sawfish</strong>.</p>
