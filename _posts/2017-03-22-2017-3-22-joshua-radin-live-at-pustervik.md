<p>This week, Joshua Radin was in town and played at <a target="_blank" href="http://pustervik.nu">Pustervik</a>. I was at his concert in Stockholm a couple of years back and it was great to watch him live again! He played a lot of old songs this time, to the great delight of my wife. She is a fan from the very beginning... I'm more of a late convert, I confess :)</p>
<p>We were both very tired from work (the gig was on a Tuesday), but we left the concert with our hearts and minds in a very good place. Thank you Joshua!</p>
