<p>We recently embarked on a Stena Line ferry traveling from Gothenburg to Kiel. The ferry is as tall as a building and the view from its deck is pretty spectacular. I took the chance of shooting a couple of panoramas from such a vantage point to capture the feeling of dominance over the city that you get from there.</p>
<p>This is the view towards the open sea. The ferry goes under the big bridge and it feels like you could almost touch it. Pretty cool (also temperature-wise).:</p>
