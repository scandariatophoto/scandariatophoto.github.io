<p>Hello !</p>
<p>A common stereotype about Swedes is that they keep their distance, both in a figurative and literal sense. For instance, it is said that, when waiting for a bus, they try to keep apart from each other as much as possible. Like ions with the same charge. I think this stereotype is largely exaggerated. Although it is true that it's easier to get more personal space here than elsewhere. This is a healthy "space cushion", which often you don't get in Southern countries. Anyway, I shot this picture at a bus stop with two benches and two girls waiting for the next bus. I believe the picture is a good, ironic representation of the stereotype nonetheless.</p>
<p>That's it for now...</p>
