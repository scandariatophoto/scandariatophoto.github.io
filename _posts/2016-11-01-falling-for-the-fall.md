<p>Last Saturday, I went to the park (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slottsskogen">Slottsskogen</a>) and took a few portraits of my lovely wife. This is the one I like the most. And <a target="_blank" href="https://500px.com/photo/180303693/falling-for-the-fall-by-ess-photos">500px</a> seem to like it a lot too :-)</p>
