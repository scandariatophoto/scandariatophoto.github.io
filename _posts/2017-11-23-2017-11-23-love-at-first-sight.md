<p>For my birthday, I got my very first <a target="_blank" href="http://strobist.blogspot.se/2015/04/your-basic-lighting-kit-spin-around.html">lighting kit</a> (flash +&nbsp;wireless trigger +&nbsp;light stand + 3-in-1 umbrella). As soon as I put the kit together, I tested it out with a very special model (my father). The seventh click of my camera produced the picture below. It's a case of instant love with lighting! So much to learn now...</p>

<p>And this is click number 2, which required some post production to darken the background.</p>
