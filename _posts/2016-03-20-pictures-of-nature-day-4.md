<p>Hello !</p>
<p>My forth picture (in response to a Facebook challenge about posting 7 pictures of nature in a row) was shot in an unexpected place. Close to home, there is a <em><strong>large cemetery</strong></em>, the kind of place with green fields and low-rise commemorative stones. Some of the stones were decorated with extreme care with angels, pebbles, little messages and so on. Quite cute (by cemetery standards, of course).Â After walking around for about 30 minutes, I found a this patch of yellow flowers in the shade (Google says it's a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudbeckia">rudbeckia</a>). I remembered a tip I once read about flowers: <em><strong>shooting up</strong></em> to them gives an interesting perspective because normally we are used to <em><strong>look down</strong></em> to them. The flipping screen of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d750.html">camera</a> came in very handy in this case as I had to position the camera very close to the ground and at a quite odd angle. Without it I would have had to lay in the dirt, which I really wouldn't have liked. I didn't need to draw more attention as the people around were giving me that weird look already (taking pictures in a cemetery, really?!)</p>
<p>That's it for now... enjoy the first day of Spring.</p>
