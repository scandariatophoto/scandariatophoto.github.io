title: Two new toys
---

<p>The Christmas days have brought two new photographic toys to play with. The <b>first</b> one (courtesy of my wife) is a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Kenko-Nahringe-fÃ¼r-Nikon-schwarz/dp/B000MT1FNU" target="_blank">extension tubes</a> for close-up photos. These are hollow rings that push the lens further away for the sensor and allow to focus closer than normally possible (hence, the enlargement). The set has three tubes of different sizes and they can be stacked together (the more the tubes, the bigger the enlargement)</p>

The <b>second</b> toy is a gray <a href="https://savageuniversal.com/products/seamless-paper/charcoal-seamless-paper/" target="_blank">paper backdrop</a> I bought as a self-present. Kudos to my father in law for helping me install it! I absolutely love it. It's a tad darker than I expected, but it looks beautiful.
