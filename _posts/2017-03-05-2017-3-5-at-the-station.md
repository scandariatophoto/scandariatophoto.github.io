<p>Step outside of the central station in Gothenburg and you will be presented with this cute little view over a canal. Crossing it (the way these girls are doing it) is not allowed... but it's too cool to resist.</p><p>I was testing some new gear: an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1045459-REG/sigma_311306_50mm_f_1_4_dg_hsm.html">awesome 50mm lens</a> and a 10-stops ND filter (which I got as a present from my wife). This picture is a <strong>composite</strong> of one long exposure (80 seconds at f/16) to get the water and some shorter exposures (at 1/20 sec) to get the tram and the girls in the right position. I like the painterly feeling of the result.</p>
