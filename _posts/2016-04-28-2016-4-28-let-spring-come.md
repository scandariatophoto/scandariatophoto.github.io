<p>Hello !</p>
<p>Yesterday after work I grabbed my camera and I floated through the traffic all the way to <strong>Järntorget</strong>, in the center of Gothenburg. I knew the tree were in full bloom because I saw them a couple of days ago. Strange, I thought, 'cause the temperatures are still quite artic. Maybe the trees just had enough of waiting ;)</p>
<p>The <strong>guy leaning</strong> against the pole made most of this picture. Mother nature did the rest. </p>
<p>That's it for now...</p>
