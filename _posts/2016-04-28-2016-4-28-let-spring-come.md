<p>Hello !</p><p>Yesterday after work I grabbed my camera and I floated through the traffic all the way to <strong>JÃ¤rntorget</strong>,&nbsp;in the center of Gothenburg. I knew the tree were in full bloom because I saw them a couple of days ago. Strange, I thought, 'cause the temperatures are still quite artic. Maybe the trees just had enough of waiting ;)</p><p>The <strong>guy leaning</strong> against the pole made most of this picture. Mother nature did the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>That's it for now...</p>
