<p>Before the daylight hours shrink down to ridiculous levels, we took the chance to go for a walk at a nearby lake. The <strong>lake of Surte</strong> is 20 min north of Gothenburg. It's part of a natural preservation area and has an easy-to-hike path that goes all around it. Of course, we did not find the<strong> easy-to-hike </strong>path right away, and ended up on the <strong>hard-to-climb</strong> trail in the slippery woods. Eventually, we found the right path... without breaking a leg. Although the weather was grey and cold, we really enjoyed the autumn colours (hey, cloudy skies are great for pictures... wink wink). The focus, this time, was on enjoying the walk rather than photographing. So, this post is rather short by necessity (translated: "for the sake of my own marital life, I refrained from taking a gazillion of pictures this time").&nbsp;</p>
