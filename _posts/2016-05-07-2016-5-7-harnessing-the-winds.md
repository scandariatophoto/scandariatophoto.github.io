<p>Hello !</p>
<p>Often I hear the opinion that wind turbines spoil the landscape. I actually find them quite interesting and not so intrusive at all. This picture tries to prove the point by showing a German landscape that is dotted with wind turbines. I think it looks great.</p>
<p>That's it for now...</p>
