<p>While the whole world seemed to be in a buzz due to the after-math of the recent US election, this weekend I went for a short hike with a couple of colleagues (they are pictured below, together with their evil twins...). We went to the <a target="_blank" href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokedalens_naturreservat">Bokedalens naturreservat</a>, a quiet and green area by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jonsered,+Sweden/@57.7543473,12.1286357,12.03z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x464ff7a614f9cfaf:0x2601907925c7e7c2!8m2!3d57.7455944!4d12.1739021">Aspen lake</a>. It's only a 15 min drive from Gothenburg.</p>

<p>After a small detour to climb an unstable-looking diving platform (above), we ventured into a silent and still forest. There were only a few marks left behind as a lingering memorial of the short Fall that had just passed. The gray afternoon made the surroundings all more mysterious and ghostly. All there was around us was the smell of wood, the soft green of the fine moss, and the cracking sound of our own steps treading over the dead leaves.</p>

<p>At the end of a chatty stroll, we mounted a hill and our meager efforts got rewarded with an unexpected gift. We descended to the shores of a smaller lake and turned a broad and smooth rock into a natural observation deck onto the half-frozen surface. The motionless body of water added some gravity to the feeling of calmness and peace that clutches the place. I splayed out the legs of my tripod for a final picture, which you see below.</p>
