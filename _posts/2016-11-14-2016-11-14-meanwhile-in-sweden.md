<p>While the whole world seemed to be in a buzz due to the after-math of the recent US election, this weekend I went for a short hike with a couple of colleagues (they are pictured below, together with their evil twins...). We went to the <a target="_blank" href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokedalens_naturreservat">Bokedalens naturreservat</a>, a quiet and green area by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jonsered,+Sweden/@57.7543473,12.1286357,12.03z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x464ff7a614f9cfaf:0x2601907925c7e7c2!8m2!3d57.7455944!4d12.1739021">Aspen lake</a>. It's only a 15 min drive from Gothenburg.</p>

<p>After a small detour to climb an unstable-looking diving platform (above), we ventured into a silent and still forest.&nbsp;There were only a few marks left behind as a lingering memorial of the short Fall that had just passed. The gray afternoon made the surroundings all more mysterious and ghostly.&nbsp;All there was around us was the smell of wood, the soft green of the fine moss, and the cracking sound of our own steps treading over the dead leaves.</p>

<p>At the end of a chatty stroll, we mounted a hill and our meager efforts got rewarded with an unexpected gift. We descended to the shores of a smaller lake and turned a broad and smooth rock into a natural observation deck onto the half-frozen surface. The motionless body of water added some gravity to the feeling of calmness and peace that clutches the place. I splayed out the legs of my tripod for a final picture, which you see below.</p>
