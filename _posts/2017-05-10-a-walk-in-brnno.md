<p>The island of <strong>Brännö</strong> in the Southern Archipelago of Gothenburg is only 15 minutes by <strong>ferry</strong> from the place I live. Cars are not allowed there and people use funny three-wheeled mopeds to move things around. In 1935, the Swedes passed a new law that gave workers two weeks of vacation and the island became a popular place for Gothenburg residents to have a summer house (a.k.a."<strong>stuga</strong>"). It's still a popular place to go for a swim in summer. The island is connected via a small pedestrian bridge to <strong>Galterö</strong>, a small and uninhabited island that is now a <strong>natural reserve</strong>. In Galterö, we followed a circular hike of about 5 km, which often offers some lunar landscapes. The midday sun was not ideal for photography, but some black&amp;white conversion made the results acceptable :) All the photographs below have been taken in Galterö with my trusty 24mm lens.</p>
