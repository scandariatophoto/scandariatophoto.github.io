<p>Hello !</p><p>As these days I've been working hard and I've been a bit ill, I feel like I could use some sort of motivational support...&nbsp;I found this colourful van next to JÃ¤rntorget in Gothenburg and it screamed "take a picture"&nbsp;:) The sunburst is obtained by stopping down to f/16 and by covering the sun a bit with the edge of the van.</p><p>That's it for now...</p>
