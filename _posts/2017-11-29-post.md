For my birthday, I got my very first lighting kit (flash + wireless trigger + light stand + 3-in-1 umbrella). As soon as I put the kit together, I tested it out with a very special model (my father). The seventh click of my camera produced the picture below. It's a case of instant love with lighting! So much to learn now...
