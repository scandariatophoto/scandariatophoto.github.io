<p>This weekend we went to Copenhagen to celebrate my brother-in-law's birthday. On a Friday afternoon, we embarked a rather empy ferry and crossed from Sweden to Denmark. It's a 10' ride. While quickly checking the open deck, I spotted this guy and his week-end-sized travel bag. His woolen jacket was colorful and hip hip, and he seemed to enjoy the chilly outddors very much. I grabbed a quick shot. And of course he noticed!&nbsp;And left... I have to admit I felt a bit guilty for disrupting his peace. But it was a cool shot ;)</p>
