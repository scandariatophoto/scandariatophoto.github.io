<p>I'm trying to pay more attention to the details (picture above) rather than the grander scene (picture below). Sometimes it pays off, as I love the tighter photo of the water, above.&nbsp;</p><p>These pictures have been taken at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kvarnbyn.net">Kvarn in Mölndal</a>, an old industrial area from the late 1800's where the power of the water has been used for many years to run several manufacturing activities. In fact, Kvarn means mill in Swedish. The village around is very well preserved and worthy a visit.</p>
