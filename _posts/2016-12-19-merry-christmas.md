<p>It's Christmas again. One of the <strong>best times of the year</strong> (in the western world, at least). We can have fun buying some presents for the people we <strong>love</strong> and we get the chance to get reunited with our families, including the relatives we don't see so often. And, as every year, we have the opportunity to set the stress aside and truly enjoy that warm feeling at the bottom of our <strong>hearts.</strong>.</p>

<p>In front of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg_Cathedral">Domkyrka of Gothenburg</a> (the cathedral), they organized a live nativity scene. Some characters were more convincing than others, I must say ;) </p>

<p>However, the dromedar was clearly the center of the attention. Its owner proudly accepted to pose for me. In case you wonder, he is the one on the left :)</p>
