<p>Hello !</p>
<p>On <strong>Facebook</strong>, I've been challenged by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/goteborgcity">Herbert</a> (a German journalist in Gothenburg) to <strong>post</strong> one picture per day showing the <strong>beauty of the nature</strong>. For <strong>seven days</strong>.  Now, I have a confession to make: (drumroll) I'm not a big fan of Facebook challenges. I mean, I still shake my head when I think to some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCromp-klUU">"ice bucket" videos</a> we saw on FB a few months ago. This time, however, the challenge gives me the great opportunity to kick-start this blog, so it's very welcome. Actually, I like to think that Herbert nominated me for this very reason.</p>
<p>The first picture I'm posting is a dear memory of the very <strong>first time I walked on a frozen lake</strong>, ever. This might sound a bit surprising if you've been born in a Nordic (or North-ish) country where frozen lakes are as common as sliced bread. But if you've been raised in Italy (like me), you do not come across that many large outdoor expanses of frozen water (and by "not that many" I mean <em>zero</em>). This winter the temperature in Gothenburg went down to -12 Celsius and it stayed there long enough for the whole area to turn into a fairy-tail country. On a Sunday afternoon in mid January, my partner and I went for a walk at a lake called Rådasjön (i beg you not to ask me how it's <strong>pronounced</strong>). It's one of the many lakes that dot the Gothenburg's belt.</p> <p>It had snowed the day before, so we were hoping for a suggestive scenery of lake shore's vegetation covered in white powder. To our greatest surprise, the lake shore had disappeared altogether and the lake surface presented a display of droves of happy Swedes performing all sorts of exotic winter sports (like a cross-breed between skating and cross-country skiing). I was literally, ecstatically jumping on the ice, which is (a) a dangerous activity if you are in my weight class and (b) quite embarrassing for your partner when strangers are around. Anyway, it was a lot of fun and luckily I had my camera with me. OK, it wasn't <em>exactly</em> luck. I planned the whole thing so that I could take pictures in the first place and then I sneakingly sold it to my partner as a all-sooooo-romantic winter walk. Of course she knew it all along but pretended to believe me. Because she loves me. Even when I behave like I'm still 12. Which happens often. But, I'm digressing now. Anyway, I hope you like the photo. If so, <strong>please consider sharing the link</strong> on your social media. That would be terrific as I'm trying to get this blog off the ground.</p>
<p>That's it for now... have fun and come back tomorrow for day 2 of the challenge.</p>
