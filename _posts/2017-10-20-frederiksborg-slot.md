<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederiksborg_Castle">Frederiksborg Palace</a> is located 40 min north of Copenaghen, or 20 min from the ferry station of Helsinggør, if you arrive from Sweden. It was built in the 17th century as residence for Christian IV king of Denmark. It sits at the edge of a pond and it's surrounded by gardens and a park. </p>

<p>With our usual luck, the rain did not stop for a minute while we were there. So, we skipped the park and stuck to the inside of the palace instead. In one word, it is beauuutiful. We started the visit from the chapel, where we got welcomed by a small choir. Listening to the songs was nice indeed, but the the best part of it was looking at the over enthusiastic, ever-smiling, theatrically gesturing director. A real character.</p>

<p>The castle is a museum showing the period furniture, tapestries, paintings and rich decor that once adorned the residence and surrounded the life of the royal family. Probably because it was Saturday, the museum had hired two extras (a guy and a girl) who went around the palace in period costumes. They were keen on letting people photograph them, but me not being so interested in photography, I passed on that opportunity (not!). I "stalked" the female extra until I managed to take a non-posed picture of here while she was looking outside. It's my favourite shot from that day and you can see it at the top of this post! All in all, it was a humid yet funny day, which we concluded with an excellent dinner on the Danish coast.</p>
