<p>This summer holiday coincided with my honeymoon. We went to Tuscany for three weeks and it was a blast. The food, the landscape, the people... the whole package! However, I have to admit that after visiting some 20 different churches, it becomes difficult to remember the details. It all melts into a single mental memory. With one noteworthy exception: the dome in Siena is in a category of its own. This one was taken without a tripod, balancing the camera on a makeshift, precarious support. But it worked and I'm happy to share it with you. Go there. It's fantastic.</p>
