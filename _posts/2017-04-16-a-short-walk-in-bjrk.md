<p>Björkö is an island north of Gothenburg. It's connected to the mainland by a roll-on/roll-off ferry and it's only a 40' drive from my place. The island has a lot of nature and well-marked hikes, especially in the northern part. After parking the car, we went on a short stroll and we found this lovely, little pond. The lack of wind created a perfect opportunity to shoot reflections...</p>
