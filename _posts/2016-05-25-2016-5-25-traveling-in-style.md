<p>I just came back from a two-day trip to Edinburgh. When I went to the hotel for the check-in, they told me they had some unspecified electrical problem and told me they had re-booked me somewhere else. They gave me an apology,&nbsp;a printout of a Google map and sent me on a twenty-minute journey to my new hotel.&nbsp;Quite annoyed I dragged my suitcase to the other hotel and for the whole time I was thinking to the evil reviews I would have posted on TripAdvisor,&nbsp;Booking.com,&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;etc. I admit, there are worse things in this world than an unplanned change of hotel. On my partial defence, it had been a long working day...</p><p>Anyway, when I arrived at the new place, I had a great surprise. I was welcomed by a super-friendly Scottish lady in an exquisite <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kildonanlodgehotel.co.uk">Victorian building</a> with only a handful of luxurious rooms. BTW, the picture was taken in their lobby. Thanks to the gods of lodging,&nbsp;I got the largest, most expensive room they had (but at the same rate as the budget hotel I had originally booked, yeah!). The room had a high ceiling with <strong>stucco</strong>, and a big <strong>b</strong><strong>ow-window</strong> with sumptuous drapes,&nbsp;and a <strong>four-poster bed</strong>, and a <strong>fireplace</strong>, and <strong>complimentary</strong> <strong>sherry</strong>, and and and... A real treat. One of the best upgrades of my life ;) Needles to say, I slept like a king.</p>
