<p>Hello !</p>
<p>I guess this shot qualifies for the (almost) "in my backyard" category :) I found this blue, shiny, mobile ladder at a harbour nearby my place. It's about three meters high, it has wheels and I have absolutely no clue what it is used for. But it offered an interesting perspective to an otherwise grey and dull sky. I like the interplay of both symmetric and asymmetric lines in this picture, so I thought it was worth sharing. </p>
<p>That's it for now... see you soon.</p>
