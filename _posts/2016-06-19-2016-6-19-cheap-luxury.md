<p>I shot this little picture in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fredsgatan,+411+07+GÃ¶teborg,+Sweden/@57.705902,11.9682299,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x464ff364fef4278b:0x27b62a4e4bcf19a2!8m2!3d57.705902!4d11.9704186">Fredsgatan</a> in Gothenburg (a pedestrian street leading to a big shopping mall). It's not quite high-class and sophisticated. However, often the right camera angle can manipulate reality. That was the intention at least...&nbsp;</p><p>BTW, this picture reached the status of <a target="_blank" href="https://500px.com/photo/158930977/luxury-by-ess-photos">"Popular" on 500px</a>&nbsp;:)</p>
