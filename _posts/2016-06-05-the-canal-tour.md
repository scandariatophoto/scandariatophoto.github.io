<p>This weekend we went back to being tourist for an hour and finally took the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goteborg.com/en/paddan/">canal tour</a> in Gothenburg. The weather was perfect (sunny and hot) and we managed to learn a few new facts about our city. The funniest part was the people on the banks constantly waving at us... now I have an idea of how zoo animals might feel.</p>
<p>This shaky picture turned out to be quite interesting once converted to black and white. I kept the camera in fully manual mode all day (for practice) but in this occasion I forgot to keep the shutter speed on check. The result is a lot of camera shake and an interesting picture :)Â Go figure!</p>
