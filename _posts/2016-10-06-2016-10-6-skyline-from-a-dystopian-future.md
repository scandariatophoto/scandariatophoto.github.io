<p>Last weekend, my wife and I took part to the Scott Kelby's <a target="_blank" href="http://worldwidephotowalk.com">Worldwide Photo Walk</a>. One of the walks (I discovered Göteborg had two this year!) went through <strong>Gullbergskajen</strong>,&nbsp;a quay with lots of old, rusted, semi-abandoned ships. It's located very close to the heart of the city and it's a great place to visit (although I wouldn't go there alone at night...).</p><p>I had a short telephoto lens with me (a.k.a., the "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/camera-lenses/af-s-nikkor-85mm-f%252f1.4g.html">cream machine</a>")&nbsp;and fucused on some of the amazing details that were laying all around. This shot shows the top of a big, chunky generator. On the back of the camera, it looked like an abandoned futuristic city with tower buildings and &nbsp;landing spots for starships. To increase that feeling,&nbsp;I went crazy with the white balance and I took it all the way to the blue side.
