<p>Hello !</p><p>While I was walking down the canal in Gothenburg, I found a group of abandoned containers with colorful graffiti painted on the sides: two urban dragons ready to raid the city, or maybe protect her. In any event, they were so cool. This is the first first one. The other will follow tomorrow, so come back ;)</p><p>That's it for now...</p>
