<p><strong>The story, as I see it:</strong>Â This weekend I went shooting with my <em>photo assistant</em>. She took a behind the scenes picture of me pushing the limits of my gear. Here is the BTS and the actual shot.</p>
<p><strong>The story, as it went according to my wife:</strong> I thought we went for a romantic hike at the coast. Instead, my <em>husband</em> was costantly taking pictures rather than enjoing his time with me. At some point, the <em>idiot</em> even dipped his expensive gear into a puddle. I thought it was ridiculuos and took a picture. The actual picture he took is not that special, after all. Mine is funnier... and I stayed dry!</p>
<p>I let you decide which one is true ;)</p>
