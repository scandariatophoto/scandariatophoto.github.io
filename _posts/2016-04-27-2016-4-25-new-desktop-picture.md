<p>Hello !</p><p>I made a new desktop background picture for my laptop. It's both visually "busy" and "calm" at the same time. I shot it at Gullberg Strand in Gothenburg at around 8PM. The area is completely deserted at that time, with a lot of wreak boats, and the nearby road is used by local "johnnies" to test their pimped-up, loud cars. <strong>It didn't feel entirely safe</strong>. But I got a nice pic :-P</p><p>That's it for now...</p>
