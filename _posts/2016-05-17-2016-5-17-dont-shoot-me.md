<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This post is about <strong>distorting reality</strong> with your camera :) The subject of the picture is a statue on the Avenyn, in central Gothenburg. The statue shows a revolver with a <strong>knotted barrel</strong>. It's a replica of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Violence_(sculpture)">"Non-Violence" statue in New York</a>. Apparently, there are 17 replicas around the world.</p>
<p>The statue is a clear statement against violence. However, by framing it very tight, the knotted barrel has disappeared and it looks like the gun is pointing straight at the viewer. And they say a picture is worth a thousand words ;) </p>
<p>That's it for now...</p>
