<p>When we passed under the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Älvsborg_Bridge">Älvsborg Bridge</a>&nbsp;on a ferry, it was a sunny day and we were enjoying a drink and some live music on the upper deck. At some point,&nbsp;I noticed this interesting guy looking overboard, at the river shore. He was wearing the vest of a bikers' group (with a skull as the logo)&nbsp;and he looked like he got a lot of wind in his beard and his tattoos had been in a lot of places. Later he turned around, and I took a snapshot with my phone.&nbsp;He smirked...&nbsp;or maybe he smiled. Hard to tell.</p>
