title: In Paris, again

<blockquote>
I noticed it's been 18 months since I posted my previous set of pictures. In case you wonder what happed, I became a father, and photography (in general, and this blog in particular) became less of a priority ;)

<p>Work has brought me to Paris, once again. It has been years since my last visit, which was before the fire in Notre-Dame. I didn't go to Notre-Dame; I prefered to keep the good memories I have about walking on the river bank with my wife and admiring the cathedral in a winter afternoon. This time I was based in Montparnasse, the area elected by the city artists in the '20s  as their new quarter, as it is much closer to the center than Montmartre. The city never disappoints, with its elegant boulevards, tasty restaurants (I tried Le DÃ´me) and chique Parisian people.</p>

<p>My hotel was only 15 minutes away form <a href="https://www.tourmontparnasse56.com/en/" target="_blank">Tour Montparnasse</a>. The panorama from the <strong>terrace on the 56th floor</strong> is nothing short of breathtaking. I suggest you go there at sunset and stay a little longer, until the city lights light up. You'll be treated with views like these: </p>

The day after, I went for a walk on the Seine, from Pont Neuf to the Louvre. The photo below is a view of <strong>Pont des Arts from Pont Neuf</strong>, shot one hour before sunset in rather cloudy conditions. The photo is a bit of a cheat, as I composed two exposures: (1) a long one to capture the movement of the boat and to smoothen the water and (2) a darker frame to retain some color and detail in the sky.

<p><strong>Pont des Arts</strong> was a bit crowded. I decided to place my camera on a Gorilla Pod in between two benches. The plan was to get a stark composition and use a longer exposure time to blur the people away. As always, the best photo was the result of serendipity. A group of Spanish seniors decided to sit on the benches, noticed me and leaned in my frame to apologize... no need to say sorry guys, you made the shot!</p>

<p>Before going to the Louvre, the sky opened for a few minutes and gifted me with some glorious <strong>light ove the Pont Royal</strong>. I balanced my camera on the balustrade of Pont du Carrousel and took some shots. Lucky again, a suited-up man (of course, this is Paris after all) walked in my frame on the right in perfect timing with the bateau :)</p>

<p>My stroll ended at the courtyard of the <strong>Louvre</strong>. A young couple was standing in front of the main pyramid, kissing each other passionatly. Nothing says "Paris" more than kissing couples, right? It was too tempting and I took the shot, even though it felt a bit like intruding into their private moment. Anyway, maybe they were just actors paid by the city's tourist department, hehehe.</p>

<p>As a punishment, my <strong>camera battery died</strong> right when the light became perfect. I had no other choice than using my phone. It's true when they say that karma bites you in the ass.</p>
