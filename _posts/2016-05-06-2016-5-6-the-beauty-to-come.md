<p>Hello !</p><p>The botanic garden of Gothenburg is a fantastic place that has always something to offer to photographers. This time I experimented with my new close-up filter, which is a magnifying glass you put in front of your lens to make things bigger. A cheap way to do macro photography without buying a new lens ;)&nbsp;This is the shot I like the most from the day.</p><p>That's it for now...</p>
