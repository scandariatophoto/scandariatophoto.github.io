<p>Hello !</p>
<p>Shooting a landmark is always difficult, because it has been photographed to death already. Finding a new perspective is always a frustrating challenge. Of course we could just enjoy the sight of the landmark. But notoriously, photographers are masochist people who try to push themselves and annoy everybody else in the process (like travel mates, or wives). </p>
<p>This time in Berlin I got lucky and while walking around at night I found a souvenir shop selling replicas of the <strong>Fernsehturm</strong>. The lights in the shop window were projecting these interesting shadows. So the take home message is that, sometimes, the best way to photograph a landmark is to <strong><em>not</em></strong> photograph the landmark :)</p>
<p>That's it for now...</p>
