<p>Hello !</p><p>Shooting a landmark is always difficult, because it has been photographed to death already. Finding a new perspective is always a frustrating challenge. Of course we could just enjoy the sight of the landmark. But notoriously,&nbsp;photographers are masochist people who try to push themselves and annoy everybody else in the process (like travel mates, or wives).&nbsp;</p><p>This time in Berlin I got lucky and while walking around at night I found a souvenir shop selling replicas of the <strong>Fernsehturm</strong>. The lights in the shop window were projecting these interesting shadows. So the take home message is that, sometimes, the best way to photograph a landmark is to <strong><em>not</em></strong> photograph the landmark :)</p><p>That's it for now...</p>
