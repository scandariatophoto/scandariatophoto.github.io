<p>Hello !</p><p>The Swedish weather tricked me today. Yesterday it felt like Spring here, and this morning I was scratching ice off my car's windshield. Go figure! Anyway, the episode provided inspiration for today's post... a warming sunset over a frozen landscape. I hope you like it.</p><p>That's it for now... take care.</p>
